npm run import:csv
```

## Import Order

The script imports data in the following order to maintain referential integrity:

1. Leagues and Teams
2. Players
3. Fixtures
4. Matches
5. Role Usages
6. Player Match Stats
7. Historical Player Stats

## Notes

- The script uses upsert operations, so it's safe to run multiple times
- Missing CSV files will be skipped with a warning
- Invalid data rows will be logged but won't stop the import
- Fantasy weeks are calculated automatically based on match dates
